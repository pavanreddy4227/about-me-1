## About this Repo:
This repo is made majorly for two things

2. To provide best resources or materials and efficient tutorials to the people, who are planning to make their way to the **Web-Development**
## Tools Recommended:
The preferred languages you can use for publishing a repo with Github pages are Javascript, Python and so many. Few people also use the below languages, which are familiar for their simplicity in syntax

**Note**: Any efficient browser is fine and I would recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjwqZPrBRBnEiwAmNJsNqOXRmog_4r60cVSsTN0Im_qLZvh__imowYwKzZAY1CSuz63h-lwPhoCV5gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)(Windows) for publishing Github pages  because I'm using it :-)

## Contributors:
I'm Prasanna Kumar, came all the way from [Vizag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam) - The City of Destiny, located in India. Currently pursuing masters in Applied Computer Science from NWMSU.

I have an experience of 3.5 years in [Wipro Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipro) as Project Engineer, where I had worked on Unix Shell Scripting and a bit on Python.

I would like to post my favorite picture, which is with my pet dog, named as Lany.
